qutwo-internal FORK. Upstream: https://github.com/vivek-nexus/transcriptonic

Our only change is a live sink: `extension/faqutwo-sink.js` debounce-POSTs the rolling
transcript to the local faqutwo bridge (default http://127.0.0.1:8765/transcript) so the
in-page AI has it as live context during a call — upstream only webhooks at meeting end.
It's loaded by a single `importScripts("faqutwo-sink.js")` line at the top of background.js;
manifest.json adds 127.0.0.1:8765 to host_permissions. Nothing else upstream is touched.

Install: chrome://extensions → Developer mode → Load unpacked → pick the `extension/` dir.
Then turn on Meet captions; with the faqutwo bridge running, the transcript flows in live.
Override the endpoint with `chrome.storage.sync.set({faqutwoUrl: "..."})` if needed.

Sync upstream:  git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main   (our delta is additive, so
this is normally clean; hand-resolve only if upstream rewrites the very top of background.js).

Release (Firefox auto-update): ./release.sh  (bumps the version, signs via AMO, publishes the
signed .xpi to GitHub Releases, regenerates updates.json). Installed copies poll the manifest's
gecko.update_url (raw updates.json) and auto-update to the newest published version within ~a day.
So updates reach browsers when WE run release.sh — upstream changes only after a merge + release.

# FAQs

**1. Can I change the language of the transcript?**

Yes. TranscripTonic picks up the output of Google Meet captions. Google Meet captions supports variety of languages that you can choose from. Click the settings icon when captions start showing and change the language.

**2. I did not get any transcript at the end of the meeting.**

This could happen when:
1. New errors caused by Google Meet updates
2. Any unexpected events like network drop, browser crashes etc.

When this happens, it might be possible to recover the transcript, but recovery should be done before starting another meeting.
- Open the extension and click on "last 10 meetings". Click on "Recover last meeting" button present after the table.
- TranscripTonic will also attempt to auto-recover any missed transcripts, just before a new meeting starts.
